							<p>Majoring in economics, while in University Sal Martinez always saw the Real Estate market as a business where he could express his marketing flair, and tenacious personality. After University he took out a loan and devoted himself to learning as much about the Real Estate industry as possible, an endeavour that required long hours, endless courses, and many seminars.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="b-about-content">
							<p>Right from the beginning, Sal knew that he needed to implement a system. A system that could create an incredible amount of exposure for his client’s properties, giving them a competitive edge, while at the same time providing the best service possible. Such a system took a tremendous amount of development and great financial investment. It also needed time to refine and implement.</p>
<p>Sal Martinez started in the Real Estate market in the recession of 1990, just as the market went into its worst performance since the great depression. As he endured through his initial year, he continued to refine his plan and system. The nickname of Leo “THE LION” became a household name and a continuous quest for a marketing edge and superiority. Sal began to understand the power of this kind of marketing and advertising exposure. Using many marketing techniques to draw attention to his name and his client’s properties, Sal continued to build the ultimate Real Estate business, constantly improving and never settling for less than the best he could be. What good is the name if you don’t have the goods to back it up?</p>
<p>Sal Martinez joined Re/max West Realty Inc. in 1993 and began to put together an extraordinary Real Estate business. His confidence and understanding of the Real Estate market won him the respect of his clients and colleagues. He continued to develop his business by adding a professional assistant, administrative manager and a marketing coordinator to make his support staff complete and ensure smooth operation, providing the best service and results possible.  Understanding the importance of continued growth, Sal Martinez has now evolved into Sal Martinez &amp; Associates made up of a Director of Operations, Client Care Managers, Administrative Assistant, Professional Marketing Team, Field Manager, Professional Photographers, a Team of Listing Specialists and a Team of Buyer Specialists. Each one hand picked and trained by Sal to implement and perform his system.</p>
<p>Sal Martinez’s willingness to spend the extra dollars to get results for his clients definitely makes him stand out. With a Multi-Million Dollar Marketing Plan refined over the years designed to create incredible exposure and awareness, The Sal Martinez Guaranteed Home Selling System is the total package. Sal’s goal and commitment is simple, “GET RESULTS” while making each transaction progress smoothly with the least amount of inconvenience.  Each member of the team is an extension of the system created and developed by Sal Martinez designed to provide the highest level of service in the industry. The personal service you deserve with big business results. Sal is continuously looking for ways to improve no matter how powerful the system already is, keeping as advanced as possible through technology. His constant quest for improvement has taken him to Master Mind Meetings with Top Producers all over North America discussing leading edge methods to develop the best systems to achieve optimum results.</p>
