# Real-Estate-Website-Project
A fully functioning real estate website I created with a group of two other members for a university course final project. The site includes a dynamic listings page where visitors can view all the houses currently in our database with their information, a sign up page where visitors can add their home information and register it for an open house as well as many other pages. The website is responsive on every platform and includes a number of JavaScript animations for a clean and appealing aesthetic. The languages used are HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL was used for the database
